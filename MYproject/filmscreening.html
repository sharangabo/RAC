	<h1>Film Screening History</h1>
	<p>Learn about the history and development of cinema, from the Kinetoscope in 1891 to today’s 3D revival.

		Cinematography is the illusion of movement by the recording and subsequent rapid projection of many still photographic pictures on a screen. Originally a product of 19th-century scientific endeavour, cinema has become a medium of mass entertainment and communication, and today it is a multi-billion-pound industry.
		
		<h3>WHO INVENTED CINEMA?</h3></p>
		<img src="/MYproject/images/history.jpg" alt="Publicity image of Edison Kinetophone, c.1895">

		<p>No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the Edison Company successfully demonstrated a prototype of the Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.

			The first public Kinetoscope demonstration took place in 1893. By 1894 the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours established around the world.
			
			The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.</p>
